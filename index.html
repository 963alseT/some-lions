                <h2>"Some Lions" are a York based rock band formed from Laurie Hamilton (lead vocals and guitar), Aidan Gray (lead guitar), Tom Rhodes (bass) and Charlie Craigen (drums). The band formed in 2022 under the name "Some Lions Don't Talk Japanese" as a project for young musicians to be part of. They played some early support slots at venues such as Burnholme Centre and Theatre 41, and have now began to headline independent gigs and focus on writing original material. See below for upcoming gig dates.</h2>
